# Investigating_Bias_in_Fandango_Movie_Ratings
This study is a follow-up to exemplary data journalism by Walt Hickey in 2015; the focus of the study was to determine whether the movie ratings on the ratings aggregator Fandango were still biased and/or dishonest.  Using kernel density plots (<i>FiveThirtyEight</i>) to compare ratings distributions over time, a change can be noted in the ratings - the assumption is that Fandango fixed the biases identified by Hickey.
